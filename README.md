In this repo, you can interact with the Uniswap protocol v2.
I'm show an example simple swap between ETH -> WETH -> DAI. Can you find the address exchange for any other token you want to swap.[Uniswap v2 Router 02](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D) and using [Uniswap v2 Factory](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x5c69bee701ef814a2b6a3edd4b1652cb9cc5aa6f#readContract) Can you find the address exchange for any other token you want to swap.

Will you work with [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/) like development enviroment and the library [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.7.1/) that allow you to interact with remote ethereum node in this case the Kovan test network.
